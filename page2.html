    <section style="padding: 0px 30px 0px 30px;"> Empty houses full of old life trinkets, exist between timelines of human enjoyment and loss. When we look at how often humans have the same experiences or emotions in our lifetime as others do today--whether they are emotional reactions to something that happens decades ago, a stressful experience on New Year's Day 2007, an event whose consequences make us feel terrible when it comes around again two months later, or some other long-term consequence such so called "reversal"â€”we see those who died before being born had much less chance of experiencing this state than their own children does now. The difference is huge for everyone: your child dies tomorrow morning; yours will soon become disabled if he never makes new friends enough after graduating college. </section>
