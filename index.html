    <p>Hello World!</p>
    you have found yourself on the start page of my beta website. it is only young, and is my platform for learning how to code in basic html and css (code language and page styling). do give grace, as this will increase in functionality the closer we come to the final hand in.
    <p>My project is based around liminal spaces, invetigating what elements make a space liminal and places where this can be found. The beta website is exploring how far i can create a 90's style webpage reminiscient of early blogs and social medias though the turn of the last century.</p>
    <p>Feel free to explore every page and element of the website, each page will eventually have content, and many photos are clickable so you can view them in great detail.</p>

    <p>Hint: right-click -> inspect -> see what you can find in my code</p>
